# Exercise class 2


Hey everyone :)

In this repo i will be uploading my slides and problem sets with comments/alternate solutions.

NB: The slides in .ipynb-format requires `pip install RISE` or `conda install -c conda-forge rise` and should be opened in *Jupyter Notebook* and **NOT** Jupyter Lab  .
